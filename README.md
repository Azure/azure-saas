## Reference Implementation
The reference implementation provides an end-to-end SaaS service including all required microservices and their corresponding data stores to power your SaaS service.  Simply [deploy](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2Fazure-saas%2Fmain%2Fsrc%2FSaas.Deployment%2FSaas.Deployment.Root%2Fazuredeploy.json) to your Azure subscription, clone the repo and migrate your business logic.

## Deployment
[Deploy](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2Fazure-saas%2Fmain%2Fsrc%2FSaas.Deployment%2FSaas.Deployment.Root%2Fazuredeploy.json) an instance of the reference implemenation in less than 5 minutes.  Once the deployment completes, you'll have all the resources deployed in your Azure subscription. Please be aware that while the costs are low, you are responsible for any charges incurred.  Deploy the full service or deploy [microservices / componenents](docs/components.md) indivually.
