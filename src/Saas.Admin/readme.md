   ./setup.sh
   ./run.sh
   ```

Now you're ready to move on.

## How to Run Locally

Guidelines for getting up and running with SaaS Signup Administration in your local development, are identical to the guidelines found the *[Requirements](./../Saas.Identity/Saas.Permissions/readme.md#Requirements)* and the *[Configuration, settings and secrets when running locally](./../Saas.Identity/Saas.Permissions/readme.md#running-the-saas-permissions-service-api-locally)* section in the [SaaS Permissions Service readme](./../Saas.Identity/Saas.Permissions/readme.md).
