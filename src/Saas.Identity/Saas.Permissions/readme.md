# SaaS.Permissions.Service

## 1. Module Overview

This project hosts a service api for the role-based authorization of user actions. It is fully self-contained such that it includes complete copies of all necessary classes for operation. However, keep in mind that some functionality within the API does have [dependencies](https://azure.github.io/azure-saas/components/identity/permissions-service#dependencies) on other services.

For a complete overview, please see the [SaaS.Permissions.Service](https://azure.github.io/azure-saas/components/identity/permissions-service/) page in our documentation site.

## 2. How to Run Locally

Once configured, this app presents an api service which exposes endpoints to perform CRUD operations on user permission data. It may be run locally during development of service logic and for regenerating its included NSwag api client. (An NSwag file is included in the Admin project to generate its client.)

### i. Requirements

To run the web api, you must have the following installed on your machine:

- [.NET 6.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0)
- [ASP.NET Core 6.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/introduction-to-aspnet-core?view=aspnetcore-6.0)
- (Reccomended) [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- A connection string to a running, empty SQL Server Database.
    - [Local DB](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/sql-server-express-localdb?view=sql-server-ver15) (Windows Only) - See `Additional Resources` below for basic config secret
    - [SQL Server Docker Container](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-mssql-server)
    - [SQL Server Developer Edition](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads)
- A deployed [Identity Framework](https://azure.github.io/azure-saas/quick-start/) instance
    - [Azure AD B2C](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/active-directory/external-identities/b2c/) - created automatically with Bicep deployment

### ii. Development Tools

- [NSwag](https://github.com/RicoSuter/NSwag) - An NSwag configuration file has been included to generate an appropriate client from the included Admin project.
    *Consumed By:*
    - [Saas.Admin.Service](../../Saas.Admin)

### iii. App Settings

In order to run the project locally, the App Settings marked as `secret: true` must be set using the [.NET secrets manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets?view=aspnetcore-6.0&tabs=windows). When deployed to azure using the Bicep deployments, these secrets are [loaded from Azure Key Vault](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/key-vault-configuration?view=aspnetcore-6.0#secret-storage-in-the-development-environment) instead.

Default values for non secret app settings can be found in [appsettings.json](Saas.Permissions.Service/appsettings.json)

1. Start app. Service will launch as presented Swagger API.

## 3. Additional Resources

### i. LocalDB
If using the LocalDB persistance for local development, tables and data can be interacted with directly through Visual Studio. Under the `View` menu, find `SQL Server Object Explorer`. Additional documentation is available [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/sql-server-express-localdb?view=sql-server-ver16)
