## Overview

The [SaaS.Application.Web](https://github.com/Azure/azure-saas/tree/main/src/Saas.Application) module is a stub application demonstrating where users of the ASDK project would insert their code. It is the end user, customer facing application written in ASP.NET 6.0 that the multitenant SaaS solution is designed around.

## How do I use this application?

This application is designed for you to immediately start writing your own code. All you need to do to use this module is clone the ASDK repo and begin building your SaaS application inside of it. If you are not using ASDK in a greenfield scenario (ie you're porting your application or otherwise), you may choose to replace this application entirely with one that you have already.
